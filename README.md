## Teams

Jacky Zhang, Josh Zhu, Charlie Han, Lianghui Yi

## Product User Stories

- Single Installation: The product should be accessible with a one-time installation as either a browser extension or a Google apps extension. No further complicated setup should be required.

- Universal Benefit: The tool is designed to cater to the needs of both professors and students, enhancing their email management experience.

- Role Recognition: Implement automatic user role detection to personalize the experience without requiring manual user settings.

- Predefined Labels: Offer predefined labels upon installation tailored to the roles of students and professors and existing email data.

- Automatical Labeling: Labelling existing emails automatically upon first run and new emails as they arrive.

- (Deferred) Labels Extraction: Extract labels from existing emails to expand the predefined label pool.

- (Deferred) Custom Labels: Allow users to create their own labels which the system will automatically utilize in classifying emails.

- (Deferred) Label Expansion: Leverage GPT technology to expand existing labels to a bunch of representations, enhancing the system’s ability to classify emails effectively also provide privacy protection without sending any email content to GPT.

## Predefined Labels

- Course-Related Emails: Automatically categorize course-related communications into a designated folder. For example, DSAN 5000, DSAN 5100, etc.
  - Josh
- Campus Events: Aggregate emails related to campus events into a separate folder for easy access.
  - Jacky
- HR: For professor and students with on-campus jobs, the system will automatically categorize HR-related emails into this label.
  - Charlie
- Zoom/Appointments: The system will automatically categorize emails related to Zoom meetings and appointments into this label.
  - Verky
- Co-faculty: The system will automatically categorize emails from co-workers into this label, which is only available for professors.
  - TBD
- NewsLetter: The system will automatically categorize emails from newsletters into this label.
  - TBD
- Professor: The system will automatically categorize emails from professors into this label. This label is only available for students.
  - TBD
- Current Students: The system will automatically categorize emails from current students into this label. This label is only available for professors.
  - TBD
- Prospective Students: The system will automatically categorize emails from prospective students into this label. This label is only available for professors.
  - TBD

## Tech Implementation

This software mainly consists of three parts: Gmail integration, role classification, and labeling system.

- Google Apps Script(Javascript): The system will be implemented as a Google Apps Script to integrate with Gmail.
- Mail Classification Service(Python): The system will utilize a classification service to classify emails into predefined labels. The service will be implemented in Python. 
- Role Classification Model(Python): The system will utilize a machine learning model to classify users as students or professors. The model will be implemented in Python.

## DataSet Format Sample

All exported mail should be stored as tsv file for better analysis.

### Export Script

Should provide a Apps Script to export all mail in a specific label to a tsv file.
